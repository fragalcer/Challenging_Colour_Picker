# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 200 words).

When I hear the word ‘Challenge’, I always remember Captcha.
Sometimes typing Captcha words are a real Challenge.
There are times that it is impossible to type exactly the required Captcha Characters.
Quite a few times, when I was asked to solve a Captcha, I used to think that actually… I might be a robot… because it is humanly impossible to understand some Captchas.
The idea of this Assignment is to make the user to feel the same frustration feeling that Captchas have been providing to internet users around the world since 1997.
I made some Captchas impossible to type on purpose, but I guess it is part of the fun.
Any user can choose a specific colour from the vibrant colour palette… If he/she tries really hard…
